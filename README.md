# Grouping-Script-Unity-Editor
This is a simple gameObject grouping script to use through the Unity Editor. It allows the user to select the gameobjects he wishes to group and with a single selection the
gameobjects are nicely grouped under the First gameObjects' name.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## How to setup

*Keep in mind that in order for the script to work it needs to be inside a *Editor* folder under *Assets* in the Project files.*

**Steps to install:**
  1. Create an Editor folder if there is not already one in your Assets.
  2. Create a C# script named 'GoupCommand' inside the Editor folder you created (or download the .cs file).
  3. Copy and paste the code of this repo into it.
  4. Now under Hierarchy where there is the '+' sign to create objects, add lighting, UI etc you now have the option to *Group Selected* or *Ungroup Selected*
  
To properly use it just select the gameObjects you want to group in the hierarchy and then select the *Group Selected* option.
Otherwise, if you want to ungroup you can select the Parent of a game object and then *Ungroup Selected* to break the group.
